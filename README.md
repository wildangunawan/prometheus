## Prometheus

Prometheus is my final project for the Bachelor of Engineering degree in [Robotics & AI](https://ftmm.unair.ac.id/en/teknik-robotika-dan-kecerdasan-buatan-program-studi/) at [Universitas Airlangga](https://unair.ac.id). Inspired by Prometheus mythology itself, focusing on helping the disabled, I want to be able to help them further in life.

### What does this project all about?

Eating is essential to all of us, including the disabled. Being disabled means that they cannot do things by themself and need to rely on someone else, including to be able to eat. This issue is not only a problem for themself, but also a pain in the ass for their caretaker.

Hence, with this project, I'm prototyping a meal-assisting robot so they can have a meal (already prepared, of course) by themself while their caretaker work on something else. In this prototype, I'm using [semantic segmentation with fine-tuned MobileNetV3 Large](ML/CV) and [automatic speech recognition system with GMM-HMM](ML/ASR).

### Equipments & how it works

1. [Elephant Robotics myCobot 280 Pi 2023](https://shop.elephantrobotics.com/products/holiday-mycobot-pi-raspberry-pi-powered-6-dof-collaborative-robot?variant=39611105902678)
2. Any 3D printers, all 3D model used in this project are available [here](3D%20Printed).
3. Any depth camera, preferably [Intel¬Æ RealSense‚Ñ¢ Depth Camera D435](https://www.intelrealsense.com/depth-camera-d435/)
4. Any microphone
5. Any spoon, preferably plastic so it won't hurt the user should the calculation failed

In each folder, I've wrote a somewhat not-detailed idea of how it works. If you wish to learn more and study the details of this project, hit me up at sie.wildan.gunawan-2020 (at) ftmm.unair.ac.id. I'll send you my manuscript, but in Bahasa Indonesia üòâ.
